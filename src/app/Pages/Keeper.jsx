        <p className="text-lg">Keeper is a clone of Google Keep, a note-taking service developed by Google. It allows users to take notes, create to-do lists, and set reminders. The application is primarily web-based, but it also has mobile apps for Android and iOS.</p>
        <p className="text-lg">The application's interface uses a card-based design, where each note is displayed as a card. Users can create notes, edit notes, delete notes, and change the color of notes. The application also allows users to create to-do lists, set reminders, and archive notes.</p>
        <p className="text-lg">The application is built using React and Tailwind CSS. The application's state is managed using React's built-in state management system, and the application's styles are written using Tailwind CSS's utility classes.</p>
